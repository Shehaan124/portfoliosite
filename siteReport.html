	<h1>Site Report</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Embarking on the journey of learning web development has been an enlightening experience, filled with both challenges and triumphs. This report captures my experience of learning the basics of web development, including coding, design, and the debugging process. It reflects on the module experience, detailing the development of the site over the term with a focus on both technical and design aspects of the user interface (UI). </p>

	<h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
	<p>My journey began with understanding the foundational elements of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provided the structure, CSS added style, and JavaScript brought interactivity. Initially, it was overwhelming to grasp the syntax and semantics of each language, but practice and persistence helped me gain confidence.</p>

	<h2>Development Experience</h2>
	<p>The development process was a rollercoaster of emotions. The initial excitement of seeing my first webpage rendered correctly was quickly followed by frustration when things didnâ€™t work as expected. Debugging became a crucial skill. Tools like Chrome DevTools and validators for HTML and CSS were invaluable in identifying and fixing errors.</p>

	<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
	<p>Designing the website was one of the most enjoyable parts of the process. I chose a clean and modern aesthetic, inspired by sites like Apple and Google. The font choices were made to ensure readability and elegance, selecting sans-serif fonts like Arial and Helvetica. The color scheme was kept minimal, with a focus on whites and grays, accented by a primary color for highlights and calls to action.</p>

	<h2>Reflective Discussion</h2>
	<p>Reflecting on my module experience, I realize how much I have learned and grown. The structured approach of the module, combined with practical assignments, allowed me to build a solid understanding of web development. Each assignment built on the previous one, reinforcing my skills and knowledge. The feedback from peers and instructors was instrumental in my learning process.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>This journey into web development has been both challenging and rewarding. From the initial struggles to the satisfaction of a fully functional and well-designed website, every step has contributed to my growth as a web developer. I look forward to continuing this journey, building more complex and interactive web applications in the future.</p>
